# Welcome to the Frost School of Music Concert Hall RIR Suite! 

This is a collection of room impulse responses (RIRs) 
that were recorded for my Master's Thesis project: Speech Transmission Index Estimation for Non-Classroom Spaces.
At the Frost School we have 4 main spaces that we perform in and rehearse in. They are:

  ## Gusman Concert Hall:

  Gusman is the main large hall on campus. It seats up to 600 people and is generally used for large ensembles such as the Frost Symphony Orchestra and various Frost jazz bands.
  
  ## Clarke Recital Hall:

  Clarke is a smaller, 150-seat multi-purpose space. It frequently hosts string quartets, contemporary ensembles, jazz, pop performances, and lectures.

  ## Hormel Music Innovation Stage:

  Hormel is a large open concept space that seats about 300 people. It’s commonly used for professional-grade recordings and rehearsals. Thanks to its open layout, Hormel also supports pop and experimental music, particularly during the annual CAM Festival.

  ## Newman Recital Hall:

  Newman is the primary small recital space on campus, typically used for classical music performances. It seats around 200 people and features a long reverberation time for its size, plus adjustable curtains and wall panels for fine-tuning the space.

## The Repository
In this repository you will find a folder for each hall. Each of these folders has an 'IRs' folder and a 'REW' folder. The
IRs folder contains 32 wav files trimmed and ready to be used for any effects you would like. A total of 8 positions
were captured in each hall with 4 recordings at each position. 

The REW folder contains the Room EQ Wizard files for all of these same IR wav files. This allows you to be able to
more directly see details such as the RT times, SPL, Impulse, and other acoustic features from the recordings.
You can also re-create the IRs in the IR folder but with different windowing if you would like to try something
different to the way I windowed the IRs in the 'IRs' folders.

## Use Cases
